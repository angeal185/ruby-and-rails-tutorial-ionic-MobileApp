<hr>
<p>In this chapter, we will create a simple but operational online library system for holding and managing the books.</p>
<p>This application has a basic architecture and will be built using two ActiveRecord models to describe the types of data that is stored &#x2212;</p>
<ion-list>
<li>Books, which describes an actual listing.</li>
<li>Subject, which is used to group books  together.</li>
</ion-list>
<h2>Workflow for Creating Rails Applications</h2>
<p>A recommended work flow for creating Rails Application is as follows &#x2212;</p>
<ion-list>
<li><p>Use the rails command to create the basic skeleton of the application.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a database on the PostgreSQL server to hold your data.</p></li>
<li><p>Configure the application to know where your database is located and the login credentials for it.</p></li>
<li><p>Create Rails Active Records (Models), because they are the business objects you&apos;ll be working with in your controllers.</p></li>
<li><p>Generate Migrations that simplify the creating and maintaining of database tables and columns.</p></li>
<li><p>Write Controller Code to put a life in your application.</p></li>
<li><p>Create Views to present your data through User Interface.</p></li>
</ion-list>
<p>So, let us start with creating our library application.</p>
<h2>Creating an Empty Rails Web Application</h2>
<p>Rails is both a runtime web application framework and a set of helper scripts that automate many of the things you do when developing a web application. In this step, we will use one such helper script to create the entire directory structure and the initial set of files to start our Library System application.</p>
<ion-list>
<li><p>Go into ruby installation directory to create your application.</p></li>
<li><p>Run the following command to create a skeleton for library application. It will create the directory structure in the current directory.</p></li>
</ion-list>
<pre class="result notranslate">
tp&gt; rails new library
</pre>
<p>This will create a subdirectory for the library application containing a complete directory tree of folders and files for an empty Rails application. Check a complete directory structure of the application. Check <a href="#/app/basic/04_directory_structure.html">Rails Directory Structure</a> for more detail.</p>
<p>Most of our development work will be creating and editing files in the <b>library/app</b> subdirectories. Here&apos;s a quick run down of how to use them &#x2212;</p>
<ion-list>
<li><p>The <i>controllers</i> subdirectory is where Rails looks to find controller classes. A controller handles a web request from the user.</p></li>
<li><p>The <i>views</i> subdirectory holds the display templates to fill in with data from our application, convert to HTML, and return to the user&apos;s browser.</p></li>
<li><p>The <i>models</i> subdirectory holds the classes that model and wrap the data stored in our application&apos;s database. In most frameworks, this part of the application can grow pretty messy, tedious, verbose, and error-prone. Rails makes it dead simple.</p></li>
<li><p>The <i>helpers</i> subdirectory holds any helper classes used to assist the model, view, and controller classes. This helps to keep the model, view, and controller code small, focused, and uncluttered.</p></li>
</ion-list>
<h2>Starting Web Server</h2>
<p>Rails web application can run under virtually any web server, but the most convenient way to develop a Rails web application is to use the built-in WEBrick web server. Let&apos;s start this web server and then browse to our empty library application &#x2212;</p>
<p>This server will be started from the application directory as follows. It runs on port number 3000.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
tp&gt; cd ruby\library 
tp\ruby\library\&gt; ruby script/server
</pre>
<p>It generates the auto code to start the server</p>
<p>This will start your WEBrick web server.</p>
<p>Now open your browser and browse to <b>http://127.0.0.1:3000</b>. If everything is gone fine, then you should see a greeting message from WEBrick, otherwise there is something wrong with your setting. </p>
<h2>What is next?</h2>
<p>The next chapter explains how to create databases for your application and what is the configuration required to access these created databases.</p>
<p>Further, we will see what Rails Migration is and how it is used to maintain database tables.</p>
