<p>Ruby is a pure object-oriented programming language. It was created in 1993 by Yukihiro Matsumoto of Japan.</p>
<p>You can find the name Yukihiro Matsumoto on the Ruby mailing list at www.ruby-lang.org. Matsumoto is also known as Matz in the Ruby community.</p>
<p><b>Ruby is "A Programmer's Best Friend".</b></p>
<p>Ruby has features that are similar to those of Smalltalk, Perl, and Python. Perl, Python, and Smalltalk are scripting languages. Smalltalk is a true object-oriented language. Ruby, like Smalltalk, is a perfect object-oriented language. Using Ruby syntax is much easier than using Smalltalk syntax.</p>
